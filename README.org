* What is this?

This is a script for binding to the XF86Display key for easy setup of external displays. It attempts to mimic the Windows 7 behavior.

When there is only one display available, it sets it to be primary. When
there is more than one display available, first it sets it to be on the
left of the internal display. If run again, next it sets the external
display to be on the right of the internal display. If run a third time, it
sets the external display to be a clone of the internal display with the
desktop size set as the maximum of the possible resolutions. Finally if run
again (and as long as there is more than one display available) it goes
back to the external display on the left of the internal.

* How to install?

  - Bind it to Fn-F7

    * call it from /etc/acpi/videobtn.sh
    * if you use KDE, configure a global shortcut to run it
    * if you use a window manager other than metacity or kwin, bind it in
      your window manager
